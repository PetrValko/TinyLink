# **License Overview**
This document outlines the usage rights for the TinyLink repository. We use two different licenses: a very open license (MIT) for the core code and a protected license for the design assets, which helps maintain the brand identity of the official TinyLink site.

## **Code License (MIT)**
All files containing the core application logic, Python source code, and configuration files are licensed under the highly permissive MIT License. This means you are free to use, copy, modify, and redistribute the application's underlying functions.

## **Assets and Design License (All Rights Reserved)**

The creative elements of the TinyLink website, including all custom user interface files, images, and design files, are reserved by the copyright **holder** (Petr Valko) to protect the brand identity of the official site.

**Copyright (c) 2025 Petr Valko**

This license applies to files under these directories, which contain all UI, styling, and design elements:

**./static/**
**./templates/**

**What you CAN do:** You are allowed to use these assets when deploying the unmodified TinyLink software for your own personal use.

**What you CANNOT do:** You may not redistribute, modify, or use these specific assets (like logos or CSS themes) for commercial purposes or in other projects without prior written permission from Petr Valko.
