# **TinyLink Public Repo**

Hey there! Welcome to the TinyLink public repository.
This is the code for a local, self-hosted version of the URL shortener I run over at https://tinylink.pvsolutions.dev/. They do the same thing, even if the official public page looks a little different.
If you just need a shortener that works and that other people can access, please feel free to use the official site—I always appreciate the support!

## Getting Started (How to Run It)

You'll need Python installed to make this work. All the specific dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Install the Code: First, clone the project from GitHub and open the directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/PetrValko/TinyLink
cd TinyLink
```
Install the Requirements: Use pip to install everything needed to run the app:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

How to run it: To run the main script, enter this command:
```
python app.py
```
You should see a message telling you that the code is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (by default)

## A Few Heads-Up

* Updates: I'll try to keep this public repo updated, but don't expect every little change on the official site to show up here instantly. Sometimes I'm busy.
* Issues and Contributions: If something's broken, feel free to open an issue. I have a life, so I can't promise an immediate fix, but I'll definitely look when I have a spare moment. No promises, but I appreciate the heads-up!
